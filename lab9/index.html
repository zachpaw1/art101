		<h1>Challenge</h1>
		<p> For this weeks lab, we were tasked to experiment with DOM manipulation. Here,
      we had to get elements by Ids, then change elements in our HTML by using these
      elementByIds.

		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p> For the longest time, I didn't know why my code didn't work. However, I found output
      that it wasn't working because of one. Single. Uppercase. Letter. Other than that, the
      lab went fine.
