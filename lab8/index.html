		<h1>Challenge</h1>
		<p> For this weeks lab, we were tasked to experiment with JavaScript functions. We
      had to first make a function, then create various variables to not only give a
      window prompt, but also to split the input into an array, sort that array, then
      join the array. Finally, we had to return the sorted name that was given.

		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p> For this lab, I didn't run into too many problems. I just ran into a few naming
      errors, as I accidentally put two of the same letter, thus making the code not work
      at all.
