		<h1>Challenge</h1>
		<p> For this weeks lab, we were tasked to experiment with anonymous functions and callbacks.
      We had to create a number array in our console, map it to a function, then
      return the result of that mapped function.

	<div id="lab8Problems">
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p> For this lab, I didn't run into a problem per se, but for some reason, when I went into the console,
      my console logs wouldn't show the array. For example, when I did ()"Here is my first array:, ", numberArray),
      it would show array(5). However, there is a dropdown menu next to the array, which when clicked on, actually shows the array.
      It's not how the lab page shows it, but I figured since the array still shows up, it is fine.

	<div id="lab8Results">
		<h2>Results</h2>
    <p> If you look in the console, then you can see the results! </p>
