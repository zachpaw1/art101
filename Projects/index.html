		<h1>Challenge</h1>
		<p>For this weeks lab, we were challenged to come up with pseudocode for not only
			a everyday task (which is provided below), but also for a computer task. We then
			had to turn our pseudocode into comments, and place it into our javascript.
			Finally, we had to place our pseudocode of our computer game into a pre tag.
