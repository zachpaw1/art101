		<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p> Hi there! My name is Zachary Hollaway (although I like to go back Zac). I'm from Long Beach, California
				and I am a third year AGPM student. One thing about me is that I love sports. I was on my high schools football
				team for all four years, but I also love playing beach volleyball as well as basketball on occasion. I'm also really into
				video games. Games have been a huge part of my life, and they're the reason why I want to get into the gaming industry.
				Aside from these two things, I enjoy coffee (maybe a little too much), and love to hang out with my friends!
			</p>
