		<h1>Challenge</h1>
		<p> For this weeks lab, we were tasked to create a function that depended on conditionals. Here, we had to
			create a function with a few different if/else if statements. In order to do so, we had to use things like mod and else if.
			After that, we had to create a click listener to a button, in order for our house name to show up.
		</p>

		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p> This lab really wasn't too difficult. The only thing I had trouble with was finding out how to display the newText I created. However,
			I realize that I needed to use the append method on my Output, instead of something like innerHTML.

			<p> Below, you can input your name into the text box, then hit the "Hey, hit me!" button.
			From there, a line of text will pop up, saying that "The Sorting Hat has decided! You are a "
			with a house name, depending on the length of your name. </p>
			<div id="Output">
      Please enter your name for sorting:
      <input type="text" id="input">
			<button id="button">Hey, hit me!</button>
