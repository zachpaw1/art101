		<h1>Challenge</h1>
		<p> For this weeks lab, we were tasked to create a for loop that iterated 200 times, with each number either producing a fizz, buzz,
      boom, or a combination of two words. This lab was like the function we did in class, only slightly more complicated.

		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p> The only problem I had with this lab was trying to print out my results into my output div. I finally figured it out, as I needed to
      put my str += i code into the function itself, not outside the fuction. This prints out all of the numbers, and not just 201 if I put it at the
      bottom of my code
		</p>

	<div id="lab13Results">
    <h2>Results</h2>
			<p> Below is the very long list of numbers, with the corrosponding fizz, buzz, etc. I would of gone for the bonus task to make 
      the numbers into columns, but I'm honestly too tired to try and do that.</p>
