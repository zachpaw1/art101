		<h1>Challenge</h1>
		<button id="button1">Toggle Color</button>
		<p id=text> For this weeks lab, we were tasked to experiment with creating jQuery. We had to create buttons
			that changed the color of our texts. As a bonus, we could also change the color of a button, using a separate button.

		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<button id="button2">Toggle Color</button>
		<p id=text2> There really weren't any problems with this lab. The only thing that might of been a problem was making sure all of the #
			and whatnot were in the correct spots, or just there in general.
